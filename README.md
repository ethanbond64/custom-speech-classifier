This is a small local web app interface that classifies a speech as a political speech or not

It does this by comparing the speech to historically applauded political speeches, and then the comparison is passed through a random forest classifier

Here is an example of it classifying a non-political speech (Larry Ellison's USC commencement speech) as non-political
